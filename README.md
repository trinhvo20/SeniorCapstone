# SeniorCapstone

Itin is a collaborative trip planning android application. Our app offers the ability to add your family and friends to your trip where they can see live updates or edit the trip; depending on what permissions are allowed to them. 

## Homepage - Trips:

  Users are able to document in as much detail as they would like for each hour of each day of their trip. This can include adding specific activities for each day,    filled with the adress of the activity, expected price, time, and any other notes you would like to add. Also when you show up you can check in on the app to let your friends know you are there!

## Profile Page:

  You are able to customize your experience by either using the data provided by your gmail or setting custom usernames that others on the app will see you by. You can also set notification settings as well as some other basic security settings that there are to explore.

## Social:

  When beginning development we really wanted to focus on the social aspect of our application. You are able to add friends by username and this is the backbone of how the sharing system works. Within each trip there is the option to share, this is where you can either add users to the tip VIA username or directly from your friends list; as well as grant them permissions based on what they should be able to do. Another social feature is that when you click on your friend's account, you can see their phone number and email for multiple ways to communicate. A final social feature we implemented is a live chat feature so that you can have a group chat for each of the trips you are a part of.
  
## Firebase:

  Our app is backed by Firebase Authentication as well as Firebase Realtime DB. The authentication side simply allows us to use Google SSO for our app. We store all of the above information on Realtime DB and have created a strong design that is relatively easy to acces in our code.
